I developed a 3D Pong game in Three.js featuring a dynamic tournament mechanic that allows for variable player counts. The game includes customizable elements such as paddle accelerators and the ability to freeze the opponent's paddle. Each match has multiple camera views, and I implemented a dynamic camera using OrbitControls. Additionally, I added a shake effect whenever the ball is hit. The game is written in a modular fashion, and includes a multiplayer mode that supports multiple players on the same keyboard.
